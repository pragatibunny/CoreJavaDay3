Write a program to read a string and return a modified string based on the following rules. 

Return the String without the first 2 characters except when 

Keep the first char if it is 'k' 

Keep the second char if it is 'b'. 

Create a class UserMainCode with a static method getString which accepts a string and the return type (string) should be the modified string based on the above rules. Consider all letters in the input to be small case. 

 

Input and Output Format: 

Input consists of a string with maximum size of 100 characters. 

Output consists of a string. 

 

Sample Input 1: 

        hello 

Sample Output 1: 

        llo 

Sample Input 2: 

       kava 

Sample Output 2: 

        kva 

 

Write a program to read a string and a character, and reverse the string and convert it in a format such that each character is separated by the given character. Print the final string. 

 

Create a class UserMainCode with a static method reshape which accepts a string and a character. The return type (String) should return the final string. 

 

Create a Class Main which would be used to accept a string and a character, and call the static method present in UserMainCode. 

  

              Input and Output Format: 

Input consists of a string and a character. 

Output consists of a string (the final string). 

 

Sample Input: 

                Rabbit 

                - 

              Sample Output: 

                  t-i-b-b-a-R 

I have created a class Calculator inside a package name com.hcl 

 

package com.hcl;

   public int add(int a, int b){ 

return a+b; 

   } 

} 

how to use add method from another package.
